On 7th & 8th of April I've been at the [Scalar Conference](http://www.scalar-conf.com/), a great event in Warsaw. Here you can find summaries of the presentations with my, totally biased and probably wrong, comments.

I have used three metrics to rate the quality of the presentations:

- **Content** - Measure of how good the presentation was from merit point of view.
- **Quality** - Measure of how good the presentation was from technical point of view.
- **Relevancy** - Measure of how relevant to me was the presentation. The best presentation has to be either general or very close to what I'm doing. Also the presentation should be slightly above our level of understanding the topic.

All the videos are avaiable [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8NC5lCgGs6Pd7RCawHK4XN0oq23oRe7U). At the end you can find links to interesting libraries/resources mentioned at the conference.

## The best
These are the presentations that should be watched. All of them are very good, both in terms of the content and quality. I've tried to put them in order from the best.

#### 1. [GETTING MORE MILEAGE FROM YOUR MONADS WITH MTL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knK70T4X7YE&list=PL8NC5lCgGs6Pd7RCawHK4XN0oq23oRe7U&index=15) - PAWEŁ SZULC
Great presentation about how we can avoid using monad transformers. Very pleasant to listen, maybe a little to fast(not enough time to present).

Content: 8
Quality: 9.5
Relevancy/Influence: 8

#### 2. [QUARK: A PURELY-FUNCTIONAL SCALA DSL FOR DATA PROCESSING & ANALYTICS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-GD8VJW8jU&list=PL8NC5lCgGs6Pd7RCawHK4XN0oq23oRe7U&index=1) - JOHN A. DE GOES
Very nice example of purely-functional programming. John presented Quark, which is DSL for creating data analysis flows similar to this available in Spark. I understood the examples but wouldn't be able to reproduce the solution. Shows how we can use GADTs and Finally Tagless to create interpreted data structures.

## The other

#### CONSCIOUS CONSISTENCY WITH AKKA CLUSTER, CRDTS AND DISTRIBUTED DATA - JAN PUSTELNIK 
Talk about distributed data structures. Great knowledge with many potential use-cases in libraries handling distributed data, but kept on very academical level. It is in this section because to be useful for me it should contain less theory and more business use-cases.

Quality: 4
Relevancy/Influence: 4

#### AKKA CLUSTER MANAGEMENT AND SPLIT BRAIN RESOLUTION - NIKO WILL 
A lot of valuable knowledge for people working with highly distributed Akka clusters.
